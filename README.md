# interactive-vector-analyzer
Streamlit app for visual vector analysis with real-time calculations and academic rounding — built for students, engineers, and educators.

🧮 **Vector Calculator - All in One**

This interactive web application was designed for students and educators who want to learn, teach, or practice **vector math** — step by step and fully visual.

Built in **Python + Streamlit**, it simulates the same calculations and rounding conventions used in educational systems

### 🔧 Features

✅ Calculate vector components (X and Y)  
➕➖ Perform operations:  
`vR = v1 + v2 + v3`  
`vR = v1 + v2 - v3`  
`vR = v1 - v2 + v3`  
`vR = v1 - v2 - v3`  

🔄 Convert angles with Y-axis to standard position  
📊 View final magnitude and angle with automatic reference handling  
📐 Accurate rounding:  
- Components: **4 decimals**  
- Magnitudes: **2 and 1 decimal**  
- Angles: **1 decimal and rounded integer**
